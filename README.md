## Svelte todo

How else are you going to play around with something new?

## Template used

## Run

`cd svelte-todo`  
`yarn`  
`yarn dev`  
Navigate to `localhost:8080`

## Initial thoughts

I like it, much easier for me to get started compared to all of the other frameworks. Still need to poke around the docs and do some more reading to make sure I understand what's going on but I'll probably make some more projects with this in the near future.
